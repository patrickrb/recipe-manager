        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line">Measure the bread flour by pouring the flour into the measuring cup, instead of dipping and scooping, then use the back of a knife to level off the mound. In a large bowl, mix the bread flour, salt, and yeast. Whisk or stir them with your hand until they are mixed evenly and you can’t see any lumps of salt or yeast.</p><p class="line">Add the water to the dry ingredients and mix it in with your hands or a wooden spoon. Smoosh the ingredients together until things look and feel evenly mixed. The dough should look uniform and there should be no dry flour left. It should feel like really wet and kind of sloppy Play-Doh. It only takes about a minute to get things mixed together. If there is still any dry flour left in the bowl, add another 1 or 2 tablespoons water and mix it in. If the dough seems really runny, add 1 or 2 tablespoons flour. The dough should be too thick to easily pour but will be slouchy in the bowl.</p><p class="line">Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap so moisture can’t sneak out and set aside to let it hang out at room temperature for about 3 hours. By this point, the dough should have about doubled in size but will still be a bit sticky.</p><p class="line">Put the dough in your fridge and leave it there at least the very least 3 hours, but preferably somewhere between a day and up to a week. The dough needs to cool completely so it&apos;s easier to handle. The longer your dough stays in the fridge, it will develop more flavor. Aging the dough gives the the yeast time to develop a deeper flavor, this is a very good thing!</p><p class="line">Generously oil a loaf pan (about an 8&quot; x 4&quot; sized pan) and take the dough out of the fridge. It will be a pretty sticky, but don’t worry, it should be. Sprinkle a small handful (about 2 tablespoons) of flour on a clean, flat surface. Sprinkle a bit of flour on the dough in the bowl. Tip the bowl over and gently guide the dough out onto the surface. Sprinkle a bit more flour on top of the dough so it doesn’t stick to your hands. Gently pat the dough to deflate and flatten the dough into a round.</p><p class="line">Fold one side of the dough into the center, then fold in the other side up and over. Gently fold or roll the dough into a tight log, and set it into with the loaf pan the seam side down and the smooth side facing up.</p><p class="line">Brush the top of the loaf with oil. Then cover the loaf with the foil, tenting the foil so that there’s room for the dough to rise about 2 inches. The foil should cover all edges of the pan but leave room for the dough to rise.</p><p class="line">Allow the dough sit at room temperature 3 to 4 hours. Store it somewhere out of the way so it won’t be disturbed. Over the course of the rise time, the dough should rise about 2 inches—it should peek above the sides of the pan but shouldn&apos;t be pouring out over the sides of the pan.</p><p class="line">If you aren&apos;t able to bake the dough in 4 hours, then let it sit out for just 2 hours, then put it back in the fridge for anywhere between 1 - 3 days. The refrigerator will slow the rise time way down.</p><p class="line">Place on over rack in the middle position, with no other racks above it. Heat oven to 475°F and allow it to preheat for at least 20-30 minutes. (If your dough is in the refrigerator, take it out of the fridge when you preheat the oven so it can warm to room temperature while the oven preheats.)</p><p class="line">Place the loaf, with the foil covering, in the oven for 20 minutes. Then open your oven, remove the foil, rotate 180° and bake for another 15 - 20-ish minutes. The bread should be a deep golden brown on top, if it&apos;s still light in color you may need to bake an additional 5-8 minutes.</p><p class="line">Remove the pan from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then carefully tip the bread out of the pan. (if it is sticking to the pan, use a butter knife to gently loosen if from the sides) Place the loaf on on a cooling rack so air can flow around it to cool it down faster.</p><p class="line">Allow the bread to cool completely before you cut into it, at least an hour. If you try cutting into it too soon, it will be gummy instead of fluffy and all of your hard work will be down the drain. Then slice and serve as sandwich bread, toast, snacking bread...however you like it!</p>

        <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>Going in, you should know that in order to develop a deeper flavor &amp; texture, you need to plan ahead a few days so your dough can age in the fridge &amp; get all of those tasty flavors going. But, the actual hands on action is only a few minutes. The absolute minimum amount of resting time I&apos;d recommend for this bread is 9 hours but you can rest/age the dough up to a week in your fridge before baking.</p><p>Once baked, you can freeze a loaf whole or sliced loaf for up to 3 months when wrapped tightly in a freezer proof bag.</p><p>Storing your bread in a natural, beeswax wrap at room temperature will help keep it fresher longer.</p>
